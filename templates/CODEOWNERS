# CODEOWNERS — Polygon Labs Base Template
# ============================================================================
# PLACEMENT: This file must live in ONE of these locations (in priority order):
#   1. .github/CODEOWNERS   ← recommended (keeps repo root clean)
#   2. CODEOWNERS            (repo root)
#   3. docs/CODEOWNERS
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#   - Branch protection must be enabled on the default branch
#   - "Require review from Code Owners" must be turned ON in branch rules
#   - Without both, this file is advisory only and won't block merges
#
# Last matching pattern wins. All repos should use this as a starting point
# and extend with project-specific paths as needed.
#
# Teams: adjust handles to match your GitHub org structure.
#   @0xPolygon/internal-security — Polygon Labs Security Team
#   @0xPolygon/dev-team      — Engineering / Dev Team
